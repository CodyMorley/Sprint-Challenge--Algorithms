#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is a fairly simple O_(n) runtime. The number of iterations scales directly with n.


b) The number of iterations climbs by a reverse factor of n here, making the iteration graph logarithmic. O_(log n)


c) This will return one iteration for each "bunny ears" (n) passed to it. If bunny ears is n, then I believe this is O_(n)
